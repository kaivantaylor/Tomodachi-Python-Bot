To start programming for the server you need the following:

1. Python 3.5+
2. Git Bash
3. Discord
4. Notepad ++ (Optional, but useful)

Please insert the "ffmpeg" folder in the root of your C: or D: directory. If not "C", or "D" whatever your main directory is.
Go to your control panel. System and Security. System. Advanced	System Settings. Environment Variables. Double click "path" for your user.
Add "C:\ffmpeg\bin" to your path and press okay.

Now you should be able to run the server with the music bot. Just double click the "Kai_Bot" .py program, or run in IDLE. You can check if
ffmpeg works by running command prompt and typing "ffmpeg -version".

python -m pip install -U discord.py[voice] =======> Open in cmd and run.
python -m pip install -U youtube_dl
